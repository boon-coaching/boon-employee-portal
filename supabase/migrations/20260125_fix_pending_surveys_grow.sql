-- ============================================
-- Fix pending_surveys view for GROW programs
-- - Use 12 as default sessions for GROW (not 6)
-- - Add grow_midpoint to survey_type check
-- - Support dynamic midpoint calculation
-- ============================================

-- First, update the survey_type check constraint to include grow_midpoint
